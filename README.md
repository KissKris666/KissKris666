- 👋 Hi, I’m @KissKris666
- 👀 I’m interested in finishing school at Strayer University and receiving my BA in Business Administration.
- 🌱 I’m currently almost done with my second year and will continue onto my third year which is exciting because I'll be finished with my degree in 2024. And I've never been really good at doing the whole school thing. But I guess things do change when you take out student loans and you have to pay for school yourself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to start my own house cleaning business eventually and I am really nervous since I've never opened my own business before.
